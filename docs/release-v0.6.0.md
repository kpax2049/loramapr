# Release v0.6.0 Acceptance Criteria

- Gateway list loads for a selected device/session (requires QUERY key).
- Selecting a gateway filters points/track based on RxMetadata presence (rxGatewayId).
- GatewayStatsPanel shows accurate stats for selected gateway.
- Compare gateway mode works (two gateway overlays).
- No regression: normal points mode works without QUERY key.
