# Release v0.9.5 - UX polish & version label

## Added
- Added hover pointer and improved tab/button interaction styling for clearer affordance across the UI.
- App name + version are now shown in the interface (`LoRaMapr v0.9.5`).

## Changed
- `Fit to Data` now deterministically fits bounds for the active visible dataset:
  - playback window points (when in playback mode)
  - coverage bins (when in coverage mode)
  - active points/track scope otherwise

## Notes
- No breaking changes.
